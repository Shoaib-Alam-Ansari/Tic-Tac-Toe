## Introduction

This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to compete against each other. It features a simple and intuitive user interface designed with HTML and styled with CSS.

## Features

- Players can take turns marking the cells of a 3x3 grid.
- The game tracks the progress and declares a winner when a player completes a winning pattern.
- It also detects a draw when all cells are filled without a winner.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Players take turns clicking on the cells to mark them with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). The game ends when a player completes a winning pattern or when all cells are filled without a winner. Players can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.
